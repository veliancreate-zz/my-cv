## Welcome to Julian Veling's CV

I am a hardworking, passionate and committed Junior Developer. Having spent 5 years in HR and recruitment, I decided that I wanted to persue a career with more depth and fulfilment. Over a period of a few months, I taught myself to use HTML, CSS, and JQuery and a bit of PHP, and built a couple of websites in Wordpress and Shopify. After realising that my future lay in Web Development, I completed the intensive 3 month coding bootcamp at Makers Academy in which we have covered:  

- Technologies 
  - Ruby 
  - Sinatra 
  - Rails 
  - NodeJS 
  - AngularJS

- Testing
  - Rspec
  - Rspec/Capybara
  - Cucumber/Capybara
  - Jasmine
  - Mocha
  - Protractor 
  - Poltergeist

I would like to work in an agile team filled with people whom I can learn from, working on cutting edge projects that push back the boudaries of what is achievable on the web.  

## Skills

#### HTML5/ CSS3

So far I have styled 3 websites without using a framework such as Bootstrap or Materialize, so I feel comfortable in solving pure CSS problems. I have also used Materialize and Bootstrap, particularly the excellent grid systems, so am capable of using a framework if necessary.

- Commercial website created using Shopify, CSS designed and coded 
- Charity website with designed with a custom Wordpress theme and CSS design
- Static documentary showcase site with CSS3 features such as embedded video and animations; SVG animations and JQuery DOM manipulation     

#### RAILS

Created a language learning site to enable people who want to learn another language to correspond directly to people whose native language corresponds with their target learning language. 

- Relational database using Postgres and Active Record
- Devise for login and authorisation  
- Used private_pub Rails gem to create web sockets for chat
- CSS with Bootstrap grid and Materialize forms
- Angular for search functionality
